Bash Script Development and Improvement Prompt:

I need assistance with creating a professional, well-structured bash script to manage CyberPanel backups and send them to Telegram. The script should:

1. Have a clean, user-friendly interface with a menu system that includes options for installation, configuration, sending backups, viewing status, and uninstallation
2. Allow customizable scheduling intervals (1h, 6h, 1d, 3d, 7d) for automated backup sending
3. Include robust error handling and colorized output for better user experience
4. Support both direct credential input and environment file configuration for Telegram API credentials
5. Be installable via a single command using a GitHub repository
6. Have a memorable, descriptive command name that reflects its purpose (managing CyberPanel backups to Telegram)
7. Follow best practices for bash scripting including secure configuration storage and proper documentation
